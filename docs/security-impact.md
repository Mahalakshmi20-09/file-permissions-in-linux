# Security Impact

Improper file permissions can expose systems to unauthorized modification, insider threats, and accidental data corruption.
By enforcing the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP), the writable attack surface was reduced and file-level integrity improved.
This project demonstrates how simple permission audits and remediation steps can significantly strengthen Linux system security posture.
