# Permission Analysis

File permissions were analyzed using the ls -la command to identify insecure configurations such as world-writable files.

Example:
-rw-rw-rw- 1 researcher2 research 2048 Feb 4 20:15 project_k.txt

This configuration allows unauthorized modification and increases security risk.
